Summary:
This is a powerful reactive programming library for Gamemaker inspired by RxJS and AngularJS
style reactive libraries.

Note:
The documentation links provided in the scripts are based on RxJS 7. These could
be out of date with later verisons of RxJS. Documentation for this 
system specifically will be available when I can get around to it. :)
